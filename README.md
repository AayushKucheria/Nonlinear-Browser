# Nonlinear-Browser

This is a chrome extension for representing browser tabs spatially using a dynamic real-time tree to enable contextual exploration.

Why? Representing tabs spatially in a hierarchical manner is useful for:
- Navigating through the browser intuitively, even with 100+ tabs
- Finding relationships between tabs to connect their underlying ideas
- Having complete context for how you arrived at a certain tab, no matter how deep in the rabbit hole you are (Esp useful during exploratory research)

[Here's](https://nonlinearbrowser.carrd.co/) the landing page.
Try out the working version [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nonlinear-browser/jjbpfnijgokebcbepdobkbneconogbkm) - there are a few bugs though! It's quite cool especially when your tree gets big.

Built using [D3.js - Data-Driven Documents](https://d3js.org/) during the cold winter of Finland and the hot summer of Australia in 2020. This started as a curiosity, turned into a working product with quite a few users, and ended as a demo for this idea. If you're find this interesting, ping [any](https://twitter.com/aay17ush) [one](https://twitter.com/sparrsh_nagdda) of us and we'll be glad to talk!
