# Nonlinear-Browser

This is a chrome extension for representing browser tabs in a tree to enable contextual exploration.

Why? Representing tabs in a hierarchical manner is useful for:
- Navigating through the browser intuitively, even with 100+ tabs
- Finding relationships between tabs to connect their underlying ideas
- Spatially moving around the tree of tabs 

[Here's](https://nonlinearbrowser.carrd.co/) how we marketed it when we were thinking about making this into a product.
Try out the (relatively) working version [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nonlinear-browser/jjbpfnijgokebcbepdobkbneconogbkm). It's quite cool once your tree gets big enough.

Built using [D3.js - Data-Driven Documents](https://d3js.org/) during the cold winter of Finland and the hot summer of Australia in 2020. This started as a curiosity, turned into a potential startup, and ended as a demo for this idea.
